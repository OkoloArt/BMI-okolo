# BMI-okolo
> _What is the project?_ - An app that calculate the BMI and Ponderal Index of a person using Height and Weight

> _What is the MVP ?_ - The Mvp is an app that collect data (name , height, weight, gender) fron the user, calculate the index and tell user what categories he/she falls under

> _What are the sprinkles?_ - The sprinkles involves styling the app, adding animations, admob implementation.

## General Information
- The aim of this project is to calculate the BMI and Ponderal Index of a person using Height and Weight.

## Built with
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes. 
  - [Jetpack Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
- [Dagger-Hilt]() - A pragmatic and lightweight dependency injection framework.

## Features
- Collect user data
- Show Interstitial and Native Ads

## Room for Improvement
- Developing for Mutiple Screen Sizes
- Weight loss/gain tips depending on what category the user falls under
- Adding Landscape UI and UX

## Acknowledgements

## What i learned

There were many things that I got in touch for the first time and also becoming familiar with already known concept. Like:

- Implementing Interstitial and Native Ads
- Coroutines, LiveData, ViewModel and Lifecycle
- Learning Dagger-Hilt 
- Splash screen API
